# Clean-Technology-Impact-Assesment
Project Overview

This project analyzes the impact of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) projects on GHG emissions reduction. The study evaluates global trends, adoption patterns, and the estimated emissions reduction potential using real-world data from the IEA CCUS Projects Database.

üîç Key Objectives

- Assess CCUS project distribution by country and project type.
- Identify trends in CCUS adoption over time.
- Estimate the GHG reduction potential of various CCUS projects.
- Develop data-driven insights using Python and Power BI.

üìä Data Sources

- IEA CCUS Projects Database 2024
- Open-source government reports on GHG emissions reduction policies

üõ† Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) ‚Äì Data processing & visualization
- Power BI ‚Äì Interactive dashboards for emissions trends
- Excel ‚Äì Data cleaning & formatting

üìà Analysis & Visualizations

- Clustered Bar Chart: Top 10 countries with the most CCUS projects.
- Pie Chart: Distribution of CCUS project Status.
- Line Chart: Trend of CCUS adoption over time.
- GHG Reduction Estimation: Projected CO‚ÇÇ-equivalent reduction by technology type.
- Donut Chart: Count of Projects by Sector
- Bar Chart: Distribution of Projects by Country and Year
- Pie Chart: CCUS Projects by Region
How to Run the Analysis

Install required libraries:

- pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
- Run data_analysis.py to generate key visualizations.
- Import ccus_projects.csv into Power BI to explore the dashboard.

üì¢ Key Takeaways

- The adoption of CCUS projects has significantly increased post-2020.
- Full-chain CCUS projects provide the highest GHG reduction potential.
- Some countries are leading in CCUS adoption, while others are lagging.
